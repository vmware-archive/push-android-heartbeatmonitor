# Push Android Heartbeat Monitor

The Heartbeat Monitor was designed to help PCF operators ensure their Push Notification service is running correctly end-to-end and provide historical data. The PCF Push tile deploys Heartbeat App in the push-service-instance in the `push-notifications` space of the `system` org. The app sends a "heartbeat" push every minute to every device subscribed to the `pcf.push.heartbeat` topic. The Heartbeat Monitor subscribes to the heartbeat topic and responds to the server every time it receives a heartbeat.

## Pre-requisites

This app requires release v1.5.0+ of the [PCF Push Notification Tile](https://network.pivotal.io/products/push-notification-service#/releases/) to work. Heartbeat App will automatically be installed in your push-service-instance. 

__Note:__ Make sure you have added a valid Google GCM Key to your Android platform.

## Setup

Begin by cloning the repo and using the closest release that matches your PCF installation.

`git clone git@github.com:cfmobile/push-android-heartbeatmonitor.git`

There is a file that you will need to modify:

1. Open the project in Anroid Studio

1. In the Project Navigator, navigate to res/raw/pivotal.properties

1. Change the GCM Sender ID to match your GCM Key 
    - __Note:__ You can find this online at your Google Developer Console under "Project Information"

1. Change the pivotal.push.serviceUrl field by replacing `push-api.your.env.com` with your push-api url
    - __Note:__ Ensure the platform UUID and platform secret match the iOS platform found in your Configuration tab on your Push Dashboard _(They should by default)_

1. Build the Heartbeat Monitor on an Android Jellybean or later device

1. Accept Push Notifications on the device

1. Ensure the device shows up in the Devices tab of your Android Platform on your Push Dashboard
